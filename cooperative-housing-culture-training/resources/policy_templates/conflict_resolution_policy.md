# Conflict Resolution Policy Template for Cooperative Housing Trustees

## Purpose
This policy establishes a structured, equitable, and transparent framework for addressing and resolving disputes within [Cooperative Name]. Its primary objectives are to facilitate prompt and effective conflict resolution, foster constructive inter-member relationships, and reinforce the cooperative's foundational values of community and shared governance.

## Scope
This policy applies to conflicts arising between:
-   Individual members
-   Members and the Board of Directors
-   Members and established committees
-   Members and cooperative staff (where applicable)

## Guiding Principles
1.  **Proactive Engagement**: Conflicts should be addressed expeditiously to prevent escalation and mitigate adverse impacts on the cooperative environment.
2.  **Mutual Respect**: All participants are to be treated with dignity and respect throughout the resolution process, ensuring a conducive environment for dialogue.
3.  **Impartiality**: The resolution process will ensure all parties are afforded an equitable opportunity to present their perspectives and evidence without bias.
4.  **Confidentiality**: Sensitive information pertaining to disputes will be handled with the utmost discretion, adhering to established privacy protocols.
5.  **Procedural Transparency**: The conflict resolution process will be clearly articulated, accessible, and understandable to all members, promoting trust and accountability.
6.  **Collaborative Resolution**: The policy encourages joint efforts to identify mutually beneficial and sustainable solutions that align with the cooperative's long-term interests.

## Conflict Resolution Process

### Phase 1: Direct Engagement
Members are encouraged to initiate direct communication with the involved party to address concerns prior to formal intervention. This engagement should be conducted constructively, focusing on the substantive issue rather than personal critique, and aiming for an informal resolution.

**Timeline**: Direct engagement should be attempted within 14 calendar days of the incident or awareness of the issue.

### Phase 2: Facilitated Discussion
Should direct engagement prove insufficient or inappropriate, either party may request a facilitated discussion.

**Procedure**:
1.  A formal written request must be submitted to the [designated person/committee], outlining the nature of the conflict and previous attempts at resolution.
2.  A neutral facilitator, selected from an approved roster of qualified members or external professionals, will be appointed.
3.  The facilitator will convene a meeting with all involved parties within 14 calendar days of the request.
4.  The facilitator will guide the discourse, ensuring adherence to process and encouraging constructive dialogue, without imposing solutions.

**Documentation**: Key discussion points, agreements reached, and any unresolved issues will be formally documented by the facilitator.

### Phase 3: Formal Mediation
If facilitated discussion fails to yield a resolution, or if the nature of the conflict warrants a more structured approach, parties may proceed to formal mediation.

**Procedure**:
1.  A written request for mediation must be submitted to the Board of Directors, accompanied by documentation from prior phases.
2.  The Board will appoint a qualified, impartial mediator (internal or external) within 14 calendar days.
3.  The mediator will establish ground rules and procedural guidelines with all parties, ensuring a fair and productive environment.
4.  Mediation sessions will continue until a mutually acceptable resolution is achieved or an impasse is formally declared by the mediator.

**Documentation**: All agreements reached during mediation will be formally documented, signed by all participating parties, and submitted to the Board for record-keeping.

### Phase 4: Board Adjudication
In instances where mediation is unsuccessful, or for conflicts directly impacting the cooperative's governance or financial stability, the matter may be referred to the Board of Directors for final adjudication.

**Procedure**:
1.  A formal written request for Board review must be submitted, including all relevant documentation from preceding phases.
2.  The Board will review all submitted documentation and may solicit additional information or testimony as deemed necessary for a comprehensive understanding.
3.  The Board will issue a written decision within 30 calendar days of receiving the complete request, outlining its findings and the prescribed resolution.

**Enforcement**: The Board’s decision is binding within the parameters of the cooperative’s governing documents and applicable legal frameworks.

## Exceptional Circumstances

### Urgent Matters
For issues involving immediate safety concerns, harassment, legal infractions, or significant financial risk:
1.  The matter must be reported directly and immediately to the Board President or a designated Board member.
2.  The Board may implement interim measures to safeguard the cooperative's interests and members' well-being while expediting the resolution process.

### Board Member Involvement
When conflicts involve a Board member:
1.  The implicated Board member must recuse themselves from any Board deliberations or decisions pertinent to the conflict to ensure impartiality.
2.  The engagement of an independent, external mediator may be pursued to maintain objectivity and trust in the process.

## Record Keeping and Confidentiality

1.  All formal conflict resolution proceedings will be meticulously documented, including requests, meeting minutes, and resolutions.
2.  Records will be maintained by the [designated person/position] in a secure and confidential manner.
3.  Access to these records will be restricted to involved parties and individuals with a legitimate need-to-know, in compliance with privacy regulations.
4.  Anonymized summary reports may be disseminated annually to the membership to identify systemic patterns, inform policy enhancements, and promote continuous improvement.

## Policy Review
This policy will undergo a comprehensive annual review by the [designated committee or Board] to ensure its continued efficacy, relevance, and alignment with the cooperative's evolving needs and best practices.
