# Conflict Resolution Policy Template

## Purpose
This policy delineates a structured, equitable, and transparent framework for addressing and resolving disputes within [Cooperative Name]. Its objectives are to facilitate prompt conflict resolution, foster constructive inter-member relationships, and reinforce the cooperative's foundational community values.

## Scope
This policy applies to conflicts arising between:
-   Individual members
-   Members and the Board of Directors
-   Members and established committees
-   Members and cooperative staff (where applicable)

## Guiding Principles
1.  **Proactive Intervention**: Conflicts should be addressed expeditiously to prevent escalation.
2.  **Mutual Respect**: All participants are to be treated with dignity and respect throughout the resolution process.
3.  **Impartiality**: Ensure all parties are afforded an equitable opportunity to present their perspectives.
4.  **Confidentiality**: Sensitive information pertaining to disputes will be handled with appropriate discretion.
5.  **Procedural Transparency**: The conflict resolution process will be clearly articulated and accessible to all members.
6.  **Collaborative Resolution**: Encourage joint efforts to identify mutually beneficial and sustainable solutions.

## Conflict Resolution Process

### Phase 1: Direct Engagement
Members are encouraged to initiate direct communication with the involved party to address concerns prior to formal intervention. This engagement should be conducted constructively, focusing on the substantive issue rather than personal critique.

**Timeline**: Direct engagement should be attempted within 14 days of the incident or awareness of the issue.

### Phase 2: Facilitated Discussion
Should direct engagement prove insufficient, either party may request a facilitated discussion.

**Procedure**:
1.  Submit a formal written request to the [designated person/committee].
2.  A neutral facilitator will be selected from an approved roster of qualified members.
3.  The facilitator will convene a meeting with all involved parties within 14 days of the request.
4.  The facilitator will guide the discourse without imposing solutions.

**Documentation**: Key discussion points and any agreements reached will be formally documented by the facilitator.

### Phase 3: Formal Mediation
If facilitated discussion fails to yield a resolution, parties may proceed to formal mediation.

**Procedure**:
1.  Submit a written request for mediation to the Board of Directors.
2.  The Board will appoint a qualified mediator (internal or external) within 14 days.
3.  The mediator will establish ground rules and procedural guidelines with all parties.
4.  Mediation sessions will continue until a resolution is achieved or an impasse is declared.

**Documentation**: All agreements reached during mediation will be formally documented and signed by all participating parties.

### Phase 4: Board Adjudication
In instances where mediation is unsuccessful, the matter may be referred to the Board of Directors for final adjudication.

**Procedure**:
1.  Submit a written request for Board review.
2.  The Board will review all documentation from preceding phases.
3.  The Board may solicit additional information or testimony as deemed necessary.
4.  The Board will issue a written decision within 30 days.

**Enforcement**: The Board’s decision is binding within the parameters of the cooperative’s governing documents.

## Exceptional Circumstances

### Urgent Matters
For issues involving immediate safety concerns, harassment, or potential legal infractions:
1.  Report the matter directly and immediately to the Board President.
2.  The Board may implement interim measures while expediting the resolution process.

### Board Member Involvement
When conflicts involve a Board member:
1.  The implicated Board member must recuse themselves from any Board deliberations or decisions pertinent to the conflict.
2.  Engagement of an external mediator may be pursued to ensure impartiality.

## Record Keeping and Confidentiality

1.  All formal conflict resolution proceedings will be meticulously documented.
2.  Records will be maintained by the [designated person/position].
3.  Access to these records will be restricted to involved parties and individuals with a legitimate need-to-know.
4.  Anonymized summary reports may be disseminated annually to the membership to identify systemic patterns and inform policy enhancements.

## Policy Review
This policy will undergo an annual review by the [designated committee] to ensure its continued efficacy and relevance.
