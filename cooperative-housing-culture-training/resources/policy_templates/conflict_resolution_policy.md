# Conflict Resolution Policy Template for Cooperative Housing Trustees

## Purpose
This policy establishes a structured, equitable, and transparent framework for dispute resolution within [Cooperative Name]. It aims to facilitate prompt conflict resolution, foster constructive inter-member relationships, and reinforce cooperative values of community and shared governance, specifically empowering trustees with a clear procedural guide.

## Scope
This policy applies to conflicts between:
- Individual members
- Members and the Board of Directors
- Members and established committees
- Members and cooperative staff (if applicable)

## Guiding Principles
1.  **Proactive Engagement**: Conflicts should be addressed promptly and constructively to prevent escalation and maintain cooperative harmony.
2.  **Mutual Respect**: All parties involved in a conflict resolution process must be treated with dignity and respect, fostering an environment conducive to resolution.
3.  **Impartiality**: The process must ensure equitable opportunity for all parties to present their perspectives without bias, maintaining neutrality throughout.
4.  **Confidentiality**: Sensitive information shared during conflict resolution will be handled with the utmost discretion, adhering to privacy regulations and building trust.
5.  **Procedural Transparency**: The conflict resolution process will be clearly articulated, accessible, and consistently applied to all members.
6.  **Collaborative Resolution**: The policy encourages joint efforts and open dialogue to achieve mutually beneficial solutions that uphold the cooperative's collective interests.

## Conflict Resolution Process

### Phase 1: Direct Engagement
Members are encouraged to initiate direct, constructive communication to address concerns before formal intervention. This informal approach should focus on the issue at hand, aiming for a prompt and amicable resolution.

**Timeline**: Attempt direct engagement within 14 calendar days of the incident or awareness of the issue.

### Phase 2: Facilitated Discussion
If direct engagement is insufficient or inappropriate, either party may request a facilitated discussion.

**Procedure**:
1.  Submit a formal written request to the [designated person/committee], outlining the conflict and previous resolution attempts.
2.  A neutral facilitator (from an approved roster of qualified members or external professionals) will be appointed.
3.  The facilitator will convene a meeting with all involved parties within 14 calendar days of the request.
4.  The facilitator will guide the discussion, ensuring adherence to process and encouraging constructive dialogue, without imposing solutions.

**Documentation**: The facilitator will formally document key discussion points, agreements, and any unresolved issues.

### Phase 3: Formal Mediation
If facilitated discussion fails, or if the conflict warrants a more structured approach, parties may proceed to formal mediation.

**Procedure**:
1.  Submit a written request for mediation to the Board of Directors, with documentation from prior phases.
2.  The Board will appoint a qualified, impartial mediator (internal or external) within 14 calendar days.
3.  The mediator will establish ground rules and procedural guidelines with all parties.
4.  Mediation sessions will continue until a mutually acceptable resolution is achieved or an impasse is declared by the mediator.

**Documentation**: All agreements will be formally documented, signed by all parties, and submitted to the Board for record-keeping.

### Phase 4: Board Adjudication
If mediation is unsuccessful, or for conflicts directly impacting the cooperative's governance or financial stability, the matter may be referred to the Board of Directors for final adjudication.

**Procedure**:
1.  Submit a formal written request for Board review, including all relevant documentation from preceding phases.
2.  The Board will review all submitted documentation and may solicit additional information or testimony.
3.  The Board will issue a written decision within 30 calendar days of receiving the complete request, outlining its findings and the prescribed resolution.

**Enforcement**: The Board’s decision is binding within the parameters of the cooperative’s governing documents and applicable legal frameworks.

## Exceptional Circumstances

### Urgent Matters
For issues involving immediate safety concerns, harassment, legal infractions, or significant financial risk:
1.  Report the matter immediately to the Board President or a designated Board member.
2.  The Board may implement interim measures to safeguard the cooperative's interests and members' well-being while expediting the resolution process.

### Board Member Involvement
When conflicts involve a Board member:
1.  The implicated Board member must recuse themselves from any Board deliberations or decisions pertinent to the conflict.
2.  An independent, external mediator may be engaged to maintain objectivity.

## Record Keeping and Confidentiality

1.  All formal conflict resolution proceedings will be meticulously documented.
2.  Records will be maintained securely and confidentially by the [designated person/position].
3.  Access to these records will be restricted to involved parties and individuals with a legitimate need-to-know, in compliance with privacy regulations.
4.  Anonymized summary reports may be disseminated annually to the membership to identify systemic patterns and inform policy enhancements.

## Policy Review
This policy will be reviewed annually by the [designated committee or Board] to ensure its continued efficacy and relevance.
