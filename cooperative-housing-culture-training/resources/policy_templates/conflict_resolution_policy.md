## Scope

- Members and the Board of Directors
- Members and committees
- Members and staff (if applicable)

## Guiding Principles

1. **Early Intervention**: Address conflicts promptly before they escalate
2. **Respect**: Treat all parties with dignity and respect throughout the process
3. **Fairness**: Ensure all parties have equal opportunity to be heard
4. **Confidentiality**: Maintain appropriate privacy regarding sensitive issues
5. **Transparency**: Make the conflict resolution process clear and accessible to all members
6. **Collaboration**: Work together to find mutually beneficial solutions

## Conflict Resolution Process

### Step 1: Direct Communication

Members are encouraged to address concerns directly with the other party involved before initiating formal procedures. This should be done in a respectful, constructive manner, focusing on the issue rather than personal criticisms.

**Timeframe**: Attempt direct communication within 14 days of the incident or becoming aware of the issue.

### Step 2: Facilitated Discussion

If direct communication does not resolve the conflict, either party may request a facilitated discussion.

**Process**:
1. Submit a written request to the [designated person/committee]
2. The facilitator will be selected from a pre-approved list of neutral members
3. The facilitator will arrange a meeting with all parties within 14 days
4. The facilitator will guide the conversation but not impose solutions

**Documentation**: The facilitator will document key points discussed and any agreements reached.

### Step 3: Mediation

If facilitated discussion does not resolve the conflict, the parties may proceed to formal mediation.

**Process**:
1. Submit a written request for mediation to the Board
2. The Board will appoint a qualified mediator (internal or external) within 14 days
3. The mediator will meet with all parties to establish ground rules and process
4. Mediation sessions will be scheduled until resolution or impasse is reached

**Documentation**: Any agreements reached will be documented in writing and signed by all parties.

### Step 4: Board Review

If mediation is unsuccessful, the matter may be referred to the Board of Directors for review.

**Process**:
1. Submit a written request for Board review
2. The Board will review all documentation from previous steps
3. The Board may request additional information or testimony
4. The Board will issue a written decision within 30 days

**Implementation**: The Board's decision is binding within the scope of the cooperative's governing documents.

## Special Circumstances

### Urgent Situations

In cases involving safety concerns, harassment, or potential legal violations:
1. Report the issue immediately to the Board President
2. The Board may implement temporary measures while following an expedited resolution process

### Conflicts Involving Board Members

When conflicts involve Board members:
1. The Board member should recuse themselves from any Board decisions related to the conflict
2. An external mediator may be engaged to ensure impartiality

## Documentation and Confidentiality

1. All formal conflict resolution proceedings will be documented
2. Records will be maintained by [designated person/position]
3. Access to records will be limited to involved parties and those with a legitimate need to know
