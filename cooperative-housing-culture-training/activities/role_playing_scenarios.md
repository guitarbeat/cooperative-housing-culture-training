## Scenario 1: Inter-Member Lifestyle Discrepancy and Policy Ambiguity

### Setting
Riverdale Cooperative, an 18-unit residential complex with diverse demographics.

### Characters
-   **Jamie**: Night-shift nurse requiring undisturbed daytime rest.
-   **Taylor**: Music educator conducting piano practice during daytime hours.
-   **Alex**: Resident, situated between Jamie and Taylor, reporting minimal disruption.
-   **Morgan**: President of the Cooperative Board.
-   **Riley**: Member of the Community Standards Committee.

### Situation
Jamie has formally complained about noise from Taylor's daytime piano practice, which conflicts with Jamie's post-night-shift sleep. Taylor asserts adherence to reasonable practice hours (14:00-17:00) and professional necessity. Alex, an adjacent resident, reports minimal disruption. The cooperative's noise policy is broadly defined as "members should be respectful of neighbors and avoid excessive noise," lacking specific daytime quiet hours.

### Trustee Discussion Questions
1.  Identify the core needs and interests of each party, distinguishing them from stated positions.
2.  How can the cooperative's existing policies be refined for more effective and proactive inter-member conflict resolution?
3.  Propose innovative, mutually beneficial solutions that reconcile Jamie's need for rest with Taylor's professional practice requirements.
4.  Analyze the influence of individual communication styles and power dynamics on conflict resolution within a cooperative governance context.

## Scenario 2: Disparity in Member Contribution and Equity Concerns

### Setting
Oakwood Cooperative, a 12-unit housing cooperative, mandates an 8-hour monthly work contribution from all members for operational and maintenance activities.

### Characters
-   **Sam**: Long-standing member consistently exceeding work hour requirements.
-   **Jordan**: Recent member with a history of missed work days.
-   **Casey**: Work Coordinator, responsible for tracking member contributions.
-   **Avery**: Member consistently fulfilling minimum work hour obligations.
-   **Quinn**: Treasurer of the Cooperative Board.

### Situation
During a general membership meeting, Sam publicly admonishes Jordan for perceived non-compliance with work hour mandates. Jordan explains challenges due to an irregular work schedule, despite attempts to compensate. Casey acknowledges potential inaccuracies in the tracking system, suggesting some of Jordan's contributions may be unrecorded. Avery critiques Sam's public censure as inappropriate. Quinn reveals ongoing discussions regarding a "pay for missed hours" system.

### Trustee Discussion Questions
1.  What proactive governance measures could have mitigated this conflict's escalation and prevented public confrontation?
2.  Propose alternative systems for more accurate, transparent, and equitable tracking of member participation, considering diverse member circumstances.
3.  How can the cooperative reconcile the imperative for equitable participation with diverse member circumstances, ensuring fairness and inclusivity?
4.  Identify more constructive communication strategies and board intervention protocols for managing this situation effectively.

## Scenario 3: Common Space Utilization and Competing Demands

### Setting
Sunnyside Cooperative, a 30-unit complex with shared amenities including a community room, garden, and workshop.

### Characters
-   **Robin**: Member seeking consistent use of the community room for weekly meditation sessions.
-   **Dakota**: New member requesting the same time slot for a children’s playgroup.
-   **Hayden**: Common Space Coordinator, responsible for scheduling.
-   **Finley**: Member of the Cooperative Board.
-   **Blake**: Long-term resident concerned about potential noise impacts.

### Situation
Robin uses the community room weekly for meditation. Dakota, a new member with young children, requests the same time slot for a playgroup. The community room is the sole facility for either activity. Hayden must develop an equitable schedule, but both Robin and Dakota are resolute. Finley suggests prioritizing Robin based on tenure. Blake expresses apprehension regarding potential noise from the playgroup affecting adjacent residences.

### Trustee Discussion Questions
1.  What foundational values and principles should inform board decisions regarding shared space allocation and conflict resolution?
2.  Develop a comprehensive framework for establishing fair, transparent, and adaptable policies for resolving competing common space requests.
3.  Identify potential compromise solutions and collaborative strategies that could accommodate all parties' needs while upholding cooperative principles.
4.  Analyze the role of board leadership in mediating such disputes and fostering a culture of shared resource management.

## Scenario 4: Capital Improvement Prioritization and Financial Constraints

### Setting
Pinecrest Cooperative, a 40-unit building over 50 years old, operates with limited financial reserves, necessitating stringent prioritization of maintenance projects.

### Characters
-   **Emerson**: Member advocating for comprehensive bathroom renovations.
-   **Parker**: Member championing exterior painting and weatherproofing initiatives.
-   **Reese**: Chair of the Maintenance Committee.
-   **Cameron**: Treasurer of the Cooperative.
-   **Drew**: Newly appointed Board Member.

### Situation
The cooperative faces a critical decision on allocating resources for a major maintenance project. Emerson advocates for bathroom renovations, citing leaking fixtures and outdated plumbing. Parker contends exterior painting and weatherproofing are more urgent for structural integrity. Reese confirms both projects' importance but states only one is feasible this fiscal year. Cameron clarifies that undertaking both would significantly increase monthly member charges. The membership remains divided.

### Trustee Discussion Questions
1.  What objective criteria and long-term strategic considerations should the board employ to prioritize capital improvement projects under financial constraints?
2.  How can the cooperative formulate decisions that equitably balance diverse member needs and preferences with fiduciary responsibilities?
3.  Propose a structured, transparent process to facilitate consensus-building and informed decision-making on critical financial and infrastructure issues.
4.  Outline strategies for proactive long-term financial planning and asset management to mitigate future maintenance challenges.
