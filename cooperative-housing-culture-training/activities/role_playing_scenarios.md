# Role-Playing Scenarios for Conflict Resolution Practice

## Purpose
These scenarios provide realistic cooperative housing situations for practicing conflict resolution skills. They can be used in training sessions, board retreats, or member meetings to develop and refine conflict management abilities.

## Instructions
1. Divide participants into small groups of 4-6 people
2. Assign roles to each participant based on the scenario
3. Allow 5 minutes for participants to review their roles
4. Conduct the role-play for 15-20 minutes
5. Debrief for 10 minutes using the discussion questions

## Scenario 1: Noise and Lifestyle Conflict

### Setting
Riverdale Cooperative has 18 units in a converted apartment building. The co-op has a diverse membership including families, students, and working professionals.

### Characters
- **Jamie**: A night shift nurse who sleeps during the day
- **Taylor**: A music teacher who practices piano in their apartment
- **Alex**: The neighbor who lives between Jamie and Taylor
- **Morgan**: The co-op board president
- **Riley**: A member of the community standards committee

### Situation
Jamie has filed multiple complaints about Taylor's piano playing, which occurs in the afternoon when Jamie is trying to sleep after working overnight shifts. Taylor maintains that they are practicing during reasonable hours (2-5 PM) and needs to practice at home to prepare for teaching. Alex, who lives between them, says they can occasionally hear the piano but doesn't find it disruptive. The co-op has a general noise policy stating that "members should be respectful of neighbors and avoid excessive noise," but has no specific quiet hours during daytime.

### Discussion Questions
1. What are the underlying needs of each party?
2. How could the co-op's policies be improved to address this situation?
3. What creative solutions might address both Jamie's need for sleep and Taylor's need to practice?
4. How did the communication styles of the participants affect the conflict resolution process?

## Scenario 2: Participation Imbalance

### Setting
Oakwood Cooperative is a 12-unit housing co-op that requires all members to contribute 8 hours of work per month to co-op operations and maintenance.

### Characters
- **Sam**: A long-time member who consistently puts in extra hours
- **Jordan**: A newer member who has missed several work days
- **Casey**: The work coordinator responsible for tracking participation
- **Avery**: Another member who completes the minimum requirements
- **Quinn**: The board treasurer

### Situation
During a membership meeting, Sam publicly criticizes Jordan for missing work days, suggesting they're not committed to the cooperative. Jordan explains that their irregular work schedule makes it difficult to attend scheduled work days, though they've tried to make up hours at other times. Casey acknowledges that the tracking system isn't perfect and some of Jordan's hours may not have been recorded. Avery points out that Sam's criticism was inappropriate for a public meeting. Quinn mentions that the co-op is considering implementing a "pay for missed hours" system.

### Discussion Questions
1. How could this conflict have been prevented?
2. What systems might help track participation more effectively?
3. How can the co-op balance the need for equitable participation with members' different circumstances?
4. What communication approaches would have been more effective?

## Scenario 3: Common Space Usage Dispute

### Setting
Sunnyside Cooperative has 30 units and several common spaces including a community room, garden, and workshop.

### Characters
- **Robin**: A member who wants to use the community room for weekly meditation sessions
- **Dakota**: A member who wants to use the room for their children's playgroup
- **Hayden**: The common space coordinator
- **Finley**: A board member
- **Blake**: A long-time resident concerned about noise

### Situation
Robin has been hosting weekly evening meditation sessions in the community room for the past six months. Dakota, a new member with young children, has requested to use the space during the same time slot for a playgroup. The community room is the only space large enough for either activity. Hayden is trying to create a fair schedule but both Robin and Dakota are insistent on keeping/getting the time slot. Finley suggests that one group should have priority because they've been a member longer. Blake is concerned about noise from the playgroup disturbing nearby apartments.

### Discussion Questions
1. What values and principles should guide decisions about common space usage?
2. How can the co-op create fair policies for resolving competing space requests?
3. What compromise solutions might work for both groups?
4. How did power dynamics affect this conflict?

## Scenario 4: Maintenance Priority Disagreement

### Setting
Pinecrest Cooperative is a 40-unit co-op in a building that's over 50 years old. The co-op has limited reserves and must prioritize maintenance projects carefully.

### Characters
- **Emerson**: A member advocating for bathroom renovations
- **Parker**: A member pushing for exterior painting and weatherproofing
- **Reese**: The maintenance committee chair
- **Cameron**: The co-op's treasurer
- **Drew**: A new board member

### Situation
The co-op needs to decide which major maintenance project to undertake this year. Emerson is advocating strongly for bathroom renovations, citing leaking fixtures and outdated plumbing that affects quality of life. Parker argues that exterior painting and weatherproofing is more urgent because it protects the building's structural integrity. Reese presents the maintenance committee's assessment that both projects are important but only one can be completed this year. Cameron explains that taking on debt for both projects would require a significant increase in monthly charges. The membership is divided on which project should take priority.

### Discussion Questions
1. What criteria should the co-op use to prioritize maintenance projects?
2. How can the co-op make decisions that balance different members' needs?
3. What process would help the co-op reach consensus on this issue?
4. How might the co-op better plan for future maintenance needs?

## Facilitation Notes

### Tips for Role-Play Facilitators
- Ensure all participants understand their roles before beginning
- Observe group dynamics during the role-play
- Step in only if the discussion gets stuck or becomes unproductive
- Allow participants to find their own solutions rather than suggesting them
- Focus the debrief on process observations rather than judging outcomes

### Adapting Scenarios
These scenarios can be modified to better reflect your cooperative's specific context:
- Change the setting details to match your co-op's size and structure
- Adjust the issues to reflect challenges your co-op has faced
- Add or remove characters based on the number of participants
- Increase or decrease complexity depending on participants' experience level
