## Scenario 1: Inter-Member Lifestyle Discrepancy and Policy Ambiguity

### Setting
Riverdale Cooperative, an 18-unit residential complex, comprises a diverse demographic, including families, students, and professionals.

### Characters
-   **Jamie**: Night-shift nurse requiring daytime repose.
-   **Taylor**: Music educator conducting piano practice during daytime hours.
-   **Alex**: Intermediary resident, situated between Jamie and Taylor.
-   **Morgan**: President of the Cooperative Board.
-   **Riley**: Member of the Community Standards Committee.

### Situation
Jamie has formally lodged multiple complaints regarding noise disturbances emanating from Taylor's piano practice during daytime hours, which directly conflicts with Jamie's post-night-shift sleep schedule. Taylor asserts adherence to reasonable practice hours (14:00-17:00) and professional necessity. Alex, residing adjacently, reports minimal disruption. The cooperative's existing noise policy is broadly defined as 

"members should be respectful of neighbors and avoid excessive noise," lacking specific daytime quiet hours.

### Discussion Questions
1.  What are the fundamental needs and interests of each party involved?
2.  How might the cooperative's existing policies be refined to address such inter-member conflicts more effectively?
3.  Propose innovative solutions that reconcile Jamie's need for undisturbed rest with Taylor's professional practice requirements.
4.  Analyze the influence of individual communication styles on the conflict resolution process.

## Scenario 2: Disparity in Member Contribution and Equity Concerns

### Setting
Oakwood Cooperative, a 12-unit housing cooperative, mandates an 8-hour monthly work contribution from all members for operational and maintenance activities.

### Characters
-   **Sam**: Long-standing member consistently exceeding work hour requirements.
-   **Jordan**: Recent member with a history of missed work days.
-   **Casey**: Work Coordinator, responsible for tracking member contributions.
-   **Avery**: Member consistently fulfilling minimum work hour obligations.
-   **Quinn**: Treasurer of the Cooperative Board.

### Situation
During a general membership meeting, Sam publicly admonishes Jordan for perceived non-compliance with work hour mandates, questioning Jordan's commitment to the cooperative. Jordan elucidates challenges posed by an irregular work schedule, despite attempts to compensate for missed hours. Casey acknowledges potential inaccuracies in the current tracking system, suggesting some of Jordan's contributions may be unrecorded. Avery critiques Sam's public censure as inappropriate. Quinn reveals ongoing discussions regarding the implementation of a 


"pay for missed hours" system.

### Discussion Questions
1.  What proactive measures could have mitigated the escalation of this conflict?
2.  Propose alternative systems for more accurate and equitable tracking of member participation.
3.  How can the cooperative reconcile the imperative for equitable participation with the diverse circumstances of its members?
4.  Identify more constructive communication strategies that could have been employed.

## Scenario 3: Common Space Utilization and Competing Demands

### Setting
Sunnyside Cooperative, a 30-unit complex, features several shared amenities, including a community room, garden, and workshop.

### Characters
-   **Robin**: Member seeking consistent use of the community room for weekly meditation sessions.
-   **Dakota**: New member requesting the same time slot for a children’s playgroup.
-   **Hayden**: Common Space Coordinator, responsible for scheduling.
-   **Finley**: Member of the Cooperative Board.
-   **Blake**: Long-term resident concerned about potential noise impacts.

### Situation
Robin has established a routine of weekly evening meditation sessions in the community room. Dakota, a recent addition to the cooperative with young children, has submitted a request for concurrent usage of the community room for a playgroup. The community room is the sole facility capable of accommodating either activity. Hayden is tasked with developing an equitable schedule, yet both Robin and Dakota are resolute in their claims to the time slot. Finley suggests prioritizing Robin based on tenure. Blake expresses apprehension regarding potential noise disturbances from the playgroup affecting adjacent residences.

### Discussion Questions
1.  What foundational values and principles should inform decisions regarding shared space allocation?
2.  Develop a framework for establishing fair and transparent policies for resolving competing requests for common space.
3.  Identify potential compromise solutions that could accommodate the needs of both parties.
4.  Analyze the role of power dynamics in shaping the trajectory of this conflict.

## Scenario 4: Capital Improvement Prioritization and Financial Constraints

### Setting
Pinecrest Cooperative, a 40-unit building exceeding 50 years in age, operates with limited financial reserves, necessitating stringent prioritization of maintenance projects.

### Characters
-   **Emerson**: Member advocating for comprehensive bathroom renovations.
-   **Parker**: Member championing exterior painting and weatherproofing initiatives.
-   **Reese**: Chair of the Maintenance Committee.
-   **Cameron**: Treasurer of the Cooperative.
-   **Drew**: Newly appointed Board Member.

### Situation
The cooperative faces a critical decision regarding the allocation of resources for a major maintenance project. Emerson vigorously advocates for bathroom renovations, citing issues such as leaking fixtures and outdated plumbing that impact resident quality of life. Parker contends that exterior painting and weatherproofing are more urgent, emphasizing their role in preserving the building’s structural integrity. Reese presents the Maintenance Committee’s assessment, confirming the importance of both projects but indicating that only one can be undertaken within the current fiscal year. Cameron clarifies that undertaking both projects would necessitate a substantial increase in monthly member charges. The membership remains divided on the prioritization of these projects.

### Discussion Questions
1.  What objective criteria should the cooperative employ to prioritize capital improvement projects?
2.  How can the cooperative formulate decisions that equitably balance the diverse needs and preferences of its members?
3.  Propose a structured process to facilitate consensus-building on this critical issue.
4.  Outline strategies for proactive long-term planning of future maintenance requirements.

## Facilitation Notes

### Guidelines for Role-Play Facilitators
-   Ensure all participants possess a clear understanding of their assigned roles and objectives prior to commencement.
-   Maintain observational awareness of group dynamics throughout the role-play.
-   Intervene judiciously, only when discussions become stagnant or counterproductive.
-   Encourage participants to independently derive solutions, refraining from direct suggestions.
-   Direct debriefing discussions towards process observations and analytical insights, rather than evaluative judgments of outcomes.

### Adapting Scenarios
These scenarios are adaptable to reflect the specific contextual nuances of your cooperative:
-   Modify setting details to align with your cooperative’s scale and organizational structure.
-   Adjust thematic issues to resonate with challenges previously encountered by your cooperative.
-   Vary the number of characters to accommodate participant group size.
-   Calibrate complexity levels based on the experience and expertise of the participants.
