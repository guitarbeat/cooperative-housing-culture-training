# Mad Sad Glad Exercise: A Tool for Cooperative Culture Assessment

## Purpose

The 'Mad Sad Glad' exercise is a structured emotional reflection and feedback tool designed to foster understanding and connection within a cooperative housing environment. It provides a safe and organized framework for participants to share their experiences, identify areas of concern, and celebrate successes, ultimately contributing to a more cohesive and resilient community culture. This exercise is particularly valuable for trustees seeking to gain deeper insights into member sentiment and to proactively address underlying issues.

## Facilitator Guide

### Introduction – Setting the Stage (5 minutes)

Begin by establishing a positive and empathetic tone. Emphasize that the session is for sharing and understanding experiences, focusing on events, behaviors, and processes rather than individuals. All feelings are valid, and active listening is crucial.

*   **Emotional Reflection (2 minutes):** Invite participants to reflect on their reasons for joining the cooperative or what they most appreciate about living there. This helps to establish a shared sense of purpose.
*   **Explain Goals (2 minutes):** Clearly state that the primary goal is to hear and understand each other's experiences. Reiterate that the focus is on collective understanding, not immediate problem-solving.
*   **Set Expectations (1 minute):** Encourage active listening and empathy to foster understanding and connection.

### How to Use the Mad Sad Glad Tool (Guidelines)

Provide clear instructions on the mechanics of the exercise:

*   **Add Your Thoughts (5 minutes per category):** For each category (Mad, Sad, Glad), participants will have 5 minutes to concisely jot down their thoughts. Encourage specificity regarding situations or experiences.
*   **Use Reactions for Agreement (1 minute):** After adding thoughts, allow 1 minute for participants to review and react to others' entries. This helps to identify common themes without creating duplicate entries.
*   **Share Anonymously or Named:** Offer the option for participants to share either anonymously or with their name. Named sharing can build trust, while anonymity ensures candidness.
*   **Listen & Reflect, Don’t Solve:** Reiterate that the immediate goal is understanding. Solutions should be noted separately for a follow-up discussion.
*   **Save Solutions for Later:** Emphasize that ideas for solutions will be addressed in a subsequent session, keeping the current focus on experience sharing.

### Category Sessions

Each category session should follow a similar structure, allowing for focused discussion and insight generation.

#### Mad Category (~20 minutes)

This section focuses on frustrations and disruptions within the cooperative.

*   **Introduction to Mad (1 minute):** Introduce 


"Mad" as a space to share frustrations constructively. For example, "What's been frustrating or disruptive in the house lately? Let's focus on behaviors, systems, or communal routines that are getting in the way of making this place feel like home. No need to solve anything yet—just share what's on your mind."
*   **Fill Out Cards (5 minutes):** Participants add their own thoughts on what's bothering them. Emphasize honesty and specificity.
*   **React & Vote (5 minutes):** Encourage participants to vote/react to others' cards, especially on items they relate to.
*   **Discuss Top Notes (7 minutes):** Focus on top-voted notes. Ask: "Who can relate to this?" and "What's the impact on our community?" (Cover 2-3 top notes).
*   **Wrap-Up Mad (2 minutes):** Summarize insights. Ask, "What steps could we take in future meetings to address these issues?"

#### Sad Category (~20 minutes)

This section addresses disappointments and unmet expectations.

*   **Introduction to Sad (1 minute):** Introduce "Sad" to cover disappointments or unmet expectations in communal life. For example, "What hasn't lived up to your expectations, or what do you wish were different? This is a space to share any letdowns honestly."
*   **Fill Out Cards (5 minutes):** Ask participants to share things they find disappointing. Encourage specificity to help identify areas for growth.
*   **React & Vote (5 minutes):** Allow participants to react to others' notes they agree with, keeping new notes to a minimum for efficiency.
*   **Discuss Top Notes (7 minutes):** Address the 2-3 most-voted notes, asking: "What would help alleviate this disappointment for you or others?"
*   **Wrap-Up Sad (2 minutes):** Summarize main points. Identify potential follow-up items for future meetings.

#### Glad Category (~20 minutes)

This section focuses on the positives and aspects that bring joy to living in the cooperative.

*   **Introduction to Glad (1 minute):** Introduce "Glad" as a space to celebrate the positives. For example, "What do you enjoy or appreciate about living here? What makes you happy to be part of this community? Let's celebrate the things that make this house feel special."
*   **Fill Out Cards (5 minutes):** Participants share what they appreciate or enjoy most about the house.
*   **React & Vote (5 minutes):** Encourage participants to vote on the notes that resonate with them.
*   **Discuss Top Notes (7 minutes):** Discuss the top 2-3 notes, asking: "What values are behind these positives?" and "How can we expand on this?"
*   **Wrap-Up Glad (2 minutes):** Summarize positives and discuss how to incorporate these elements into future plans.

### Conclusion – Summarize Insights & Set Accountability (5 minutes)

Conclude the exercise by summarizing key takeaways and outlining next steps.

*   **Summarize Key Points (2 minutes):** Recap the main insights from each category.
*   **Assign Accountability (2 minutes):** Identify any key issues or ideas for follow-up. Ask for volunteers to lead or track next steps for addressing these in future meetings.
*   **Closing Thanks (1 minute):** Thank everyone for their honest participation and contributions to building a better communal environment.

## Facilitation Notes for Trustees

These notes provide additional guidance for trustees facilitating this exercise:

*   **Clarity of Roles:** Ensure all participants have a clear and comprehensive understanding of their assigned roles, objectives, and the broader context of the scenario prior to commencement.
*   **Dynamic Observation:** Maintain keen observational awareness of group dynamics, communication patterns, and emerging leadership during the exercise.
*   **Judicious Intervention:** Intervene only when discussions become stagnant, deviate significantly from the scenario's objectives, or become counterproductive. Encourage self-correction and peer facilitation.
*   **Solution Derivation:** Encourage participants to independently derive and articulate solutions, refraining from direct suggestions or leading questions.
*   **Process-Oriented Debriefing:** Direct debriefing discussions towards process observations, strategic choices, and analytical insights, rather than focusing solely on the outcome. Emphasize transferable skills and lessons learned.

## Adapting the Exercise for Advanced Audiences

This exercise is highly adaptable to reflect the specific contextual nuances and advanced learning objectives of your cooperative:

*   **Contextual Alignment:** Modify setting details to align with your cooperative’s specific scale, organizational structure, and governance model.
*   **Thematic Relevance:** Adjust thematic issues to resonate with complex challenges previously encountered by your cooperative or those anticipated in a trustee capacity.
*   **Complexity Adjustment:** Vary the number of characters and the intricacy of the situation to calibrate complexity levels based on the experience and expertise of the trustee participants.
*   **Strategic Focus:** Introduce additional constraints (e.g., legal implications, external stakeholder pressure, media scrutiny) to enhance the strategic decision-making challenge.
