# Mad Sad Glad Exercise: A Strategic Feedback Framework for Cooperative Trustees

## Purpose

The 'Mad Sad Glad' exercise is a structured framework for emotional reflection and feedback within cooperative housing. It enables participants to articulate experiences, identify areas for improvement, and acknowledge successes, fostering a more cohesive community culture. This exercise provides trustees with valuable insights into member sentiment and supports proactive issue resolution.

## Facilitator Guide

### Introduction – Setting the Context (5 minutes)

Establish a constructive and empathetic tone. Emphasize that the session aims to understand shared experiences, focusing on events, behaviors, and processes rather than individuals. Affirm the validity of all emotions and underscore the importance of active listening.

*   **Contextual Reflection (2 minutes):** Participants reflect on their motivations for joining the cooperative or aspects they value most, establishing a shared sense of purpose.
*   **Objective Clarification (2 minutes):** Clearly state the primary objective: to comprehend collective experiences, not immediate problem-solving.
*   **Expectation Setting (1 minute):** Encourage active listening and empathy to foster mutual understanding and connection.

### Implementing the Mad Sad Glad Framework (Guidelines)

Provide clear instructions for the exercise mechanics:

*   **Contribution Phase (5 minutes per category):** Participants concisely document thoughts for each category (Mad, Sad, Glad), emphasizing specificity.
*   **Affinity Grouping (1 minute):** Participants review and react to others' entries to identify common themes and minimize redundancy.
*   **Sharing Protocol:** Offer anonymous or attributed sharing options, noting that attributed sharing can build trust while anonymity may encourage candor.
*   **Focus on Understanding, Defer Solutions:** Reiterate that the immediate goal is comprehension. Solutions will be documented separately for subsequent discussion.

### Category Sessions

Each category session should adhere to a consistent structure to facilitate focused discussion and insight generation.

#### Mad Category (~20 minutes)

## Facilitation Notes for Trustees

These notes provide advanced guidance for trustees facilitating this exercise:

*   **Role Clarity:** Ensure all participants possess a clear and comprehensive understanding of their roles, objectives, and the broader context of the scenario prior to commencement.
*   **Dynamic Observation:** Maintain acute observational awareness of group dynamics, communication patterns, and emergent leadership during the exercise.
*   **Strategic Intervention:** Intervene judiciously, only when discussions stagnate, deviate significantly from objectives, or become counterproductive. Encourage self-correction and peer facilitation.
*   **Solution Derivation:** Encourage participants to independently derive and articulate solutions, refraining from direct suggestions or leading questions.
*   **Process-Oriented Debriefing:** Direct debriefing discussions toward process observations, strategic choices, and analytical insights, rather than solely focusing on outcomes. Emphasize transferable skills and lessons learned.

## Adapting the Exercise for Advanced Audiences

This exercise is highly adaptable to reflect specific contextual nuances and advanced learning objectives relevant to your cooperative:

*   **Contextual Alignment:** Modify setting details to align with your cooperative’s specific scale, organizational structure, and governance model.
*   **Thematic Relevance:** Adjust thematic issues to resonate with complex challenges previously encountered or anticipated in a trustee capacity.
*   **Complexity Adjustment:** Vary the number of characters and the intricacy of the situation to calibrate complexity levels based on the experience and expertise of the trustee participants.
*   **Strategic Focus:** Introduce additional constraints (e.g., legal implications, external stakeholder pressure, media scrutiny) to enhance the strategic decision-making challenge.
